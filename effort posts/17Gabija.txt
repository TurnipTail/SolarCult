Gabija- Lithuanian Goddess of Hearth and Flame

When thinking on domestic divinities, those gods and goddesses we can invoke in our everyday lives, no better examples come to mind than the various Goddesses of the Hearth found throughout the Indo-European world.  

Many of us may know of Hestia from our Greek brothers, however a lesser known example of a hearth goddess can be found in the little Baltic nation of Lithuania.  Known as Gabija, she was considered highly revered and certainly no goddess to trifle with or displease, but one of immense importance to the homestead.

Gabija lives within the flame in the family fireplace.  Offerings of salt, bread and water are proper gifts to this Goddess: however, only water of very high quality should be set to the side of the hearth as an offering.  Because fire is Her abode, and fire purifying and holy, one must treat the hearth with respect.  One must not spit into a sacred fire, trample it, and when using water to put it out, use of only pure water acceptable for drinking is proper for Gabija.  When rekindling fire, great care must be taken with the coals so-as to not anger the Goddess.

All of this care was taken because Gabija, and the flame, were critical to the survival of the family.  And even more, Gabija was seen as not only a messenger of the Gods, but also as a messenger to the family’s ancestors.  

So next time you gather around the family fireplace, make an offering to the Goddess of the Hearth.  Strong families are the lifeblood of our people, and from whom better to receive such a blessing than Gabija?
