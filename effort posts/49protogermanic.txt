Proto-Germanic as lingua franca between Indo-European and Uralic/Finnic

Many of us treat the ancient languages of our ancestors as liturgical
languages, that is to say, we treat these languages as sacred as they
relate to the holy breath (Önd) gifted to us by Odinn, as well as
connecting us to our ancestors.  As a result, any study of our ancestral
religion should include a healthy understanding of linguistics.

Linked below is an interesting article which describes the formation of the
proto-Germanic language from pre-Germanic (Indo-European; IE) as a language
contact event between speakers of the Uralic language family (i.e. Finns,
Sami, Estonians) and the people of the Nordic Bronze Age complex.  

Proto-Germanic is a bit of an oddity in relation to other IE languages,
most notably are the sound shifts associated with Grimm’s and Verner’s law.
 A classic example of this is the sound shift from PIE “p” sound to “f”, or
“t” to “th” (think Latin Pater vs English Father).

While the theory present in the article is not entirely soundproof, and
certainly has some issues, it is nevertheless highly interesting and
provokes some thought.  Additional evidence for this theory include recent
genetic evidence not mentioned by this article, more specifically, Y
chromosomal haplogroup N, which is classically associated with Uralic
language speakers (and some IE speakers, such as Lithuanians), and is
thought to have arrived in its current locations around the early Iron Age
(700-400 BCE).  These dates largely correspond quite strongly to the
proposed estimated dates for the Grimm’s/Verner’s sound shifts.
