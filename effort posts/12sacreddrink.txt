Over and over in Aryan religions you see the pattern of a source of spiritual wisdom for mankind, often appearing as a Sacred Drink, especially mead. This is quite often the objective of a quest by mythical heroes or gods. The Irish Salmon of Wisdom, the Norse Mead of Poetry, the Indo-Ayran Soma ect. There is quite a lot to be said about this of course. It’s a very interesting and deep subject. However I will focus here solely on the fact that the “inspiration” gained from the drink is simultaneously and interchangeably referred to as both a source of cosmic wisdom and a source of poetic inspiration. I believe that these two things were seen as intimately bound together.
Poetry, (and by extension music which is a whole other topic) in all Aryan cultures was considered highly prestigious and holy. From the Bards, Skalds and Rishis, to the great Homer. All of our sacred knowledge was passed down in the form of poetry. The use of metre assured that the core of the myths would not be altered and allowed for the monumental feat of preserving myths almost identically for thousands of years with no written records. We can tell that this was effective by looking at and comparing myths from different cultures in the path of the Aryan migration. However there is much more to the sanctity of poetry than its use as a method of oral preservation of myths and history. The actual ability to compose poetry, that is poetic inspiration, is the ability to see into the spirit of a thing, to recognize nobility and ignobility, auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, in ones surroundings. To apply metaphor and epithet requires that you look, at least glance, at the inner essence of your subject, it’s Platonic Form even.
