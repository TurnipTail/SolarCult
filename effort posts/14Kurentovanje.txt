Kurentovanje

For thousands of years our ancestors felt the need to chase away winter in the time of its climax. This tradition was kept alive in a couple of Slavic countries, one of them being the Slovenian celebration called kurentovanje. In modern times, the celebration takes place on the Sunday before Ash Wednesday in the city of Ptuj, which is known as the oldest recorded town in Slovenia. During the festival, groups of kurents or kurenti, which originally consisted of young unmarried men, but in modern times are comprised of whoever wants to participate, wear traditional thick long sheepskin garments and a mask on their faces and horns or antlers decorated with ribbons on their heads while holding wooden clubs with hedgehog skins wrapped around called ježevke, the noise of which is believed to chase away winter. In this way, the presence of kurenti announces the end of winter and beginning of spring.
