Lugh Samildánach

It is my belief, based on their correspondence to the “Mitra” archetype,
that Numa Pompilius is the Roman legendary figure matching Irish Lugh. Numa
was associated with all the arts as he divided the immediate territory of
Rome into pagi and established the traditional occupational guilds of Rome:

"So, distinguishing the whole people by the several arts and trades, he
formed the companies of musicians, goldsmiths, carpenters, dyers,
shoemakers, skinners, braziers, and potters; and all other handicraftsmen
he composed and reduced into a single company, appointing every one their
proper courts, councils, and observances." -Plutarch

This is as close a match to Lugh’s title of “Samildánach” (skilled in many
arts) as I’ve found. This aspect of Lugh is one of the reasons he was
sometimes considered similar to Mercury.

Notably, the Roman and Irish similarity on this makes sense as they shared
a recent ethno-cultural history via their Italo-Celtic root.
