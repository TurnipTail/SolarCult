LESHY: SLAVIC GUARDIAN SPIRIT OF THE FOREST

Leshy (he from the forest) is a higher spirit which rules and governs a forest he inhabits. He is the protector of all the beings which reside in his realm and is the master of the hunt. Because of his role as the protector of a forest, a leshy is able to manifest his will through it, hence why in folklore he appears as a plant, animal or an anthropomorphic creature, however, he can also appear in the form of relatives and acquaintances of the person that spots him. Some people described his as being small as a dwarf, while others described him to be as tall as a giant, which awoke the belief that he could change his height. Some stories say that a leshy is a humanoid covered in fur, while others point out that he is covered with branches, leaves and cones.

Due to all these different descriptions appearing from one folklore story to another, we can safely assume that a leshy’s physical manifestation reflects his realm, his forest. Some folklore sources mention that a leshy is accompanied by a strong wind, with the power to govern it. A leshy has no shadow and he can become invisible if he wishes so. He is credited with all sorts of forest sounds, though he can speak humanly. Depending on a person’s intentions in his forest, a leshy will either help out that person and bring it good luck or he will sabotage it and bring bad luck. According to folklore, a leshy could provide good luck in hunting and livestock grazing, for this, hunters and shepherds needed to bring him an offering, usually an egg, and conclude an agreement with him.
