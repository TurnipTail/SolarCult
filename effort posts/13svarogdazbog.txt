Svarog and Dažbog

In the Hypathian Codex, there is a tale which was translated from the language of the Byzantines. It tells us a story about the Egyptian God of the sky and his child, the Sun. The Byzantines referred to the God of the Sky as Hephaestus, and to the God of the Sun as Helios. Later, when this text was translated into Slavonic, the names were changed to Svarog as the God of the Sky and Dazhbog, as the God of the Sun:

(Then) began his reign Feosta (Hephaestus), whom the Egyptians called Svarog <…> during his rule, from the heavens fell the smith’s prongs and weapons were forged for the first time; before that, (people) fought with clubs and stones. Feosta also commanded the women that they should have only a single husband… and that is why Egyptians called him Svarog <…> After him ruled his son, his name was the Sun, and they called him Dažbog <…> Sun tzar, son of Svarog, this is Dažbog.
