Aryan Immanence vs Aryan traditions.

In the effort to reveal Aryanism as a cohesive and solid body(i say reveal
rather than create because we are talking about something that is already
there but not recognised by all) it is essential to have an understanding
of Aryan immanence.

Aryan immanence is the parrent of Aryan traditions and not the other way
around. Aryan traditions may arise and disappear in time. They arise from
Aryan immanence and because Aryan immanence is eternal, if Aryan traditions
fall away, new traditions will arise in place of the old.

Traditions can become rotted by the influence of foreign corruption meaning
that they have diverged from their source of Aryan immanence.

The rune Hagal presents a good image of Aryan immanence and its branches of
Aryan traditions. The verse in the Havamal connected to the 7th rune Hagal
also gives a good understanding of the importance of understanding Aryan
immanence.

"A seventh I know,  if I see in flames The hall over my comrades' heads It
burns not so wide that I will not quench it. I know that song to sing."

What is really being said here? Does anyone believe that there is a song
that could be learned that would literally put out a house fire? I hope
not, but if we apply this verse metaphorically to the idea of corrupted
traditions and Aryan immanence it makes a great deal of sense.

Traditions can become corrupt(catch on fire). No matter how badly that
corruption has flamed up, having an understanding of Aryan
immanence(knowing the song) we can put out that fire of corruption by
bringing it back in alignment with the nature of Aryanism.
