To unwind from the stresses of a city I am forced to live in and work for
now, I spend at least one day on the weekends to visit the local woods. In
them I marked a place that looks like no other, a really small opening in
the middle of the woods that has a single pine standing strong in the
center of the opening. I first visit this location which serves as my
sacred grove and I pour libation to the Gods, after which I spend some time
still, which gets me in tuned with the nature surrounding me. I can then
fully feel my presence as the part of something bigger, of the life
surrounding me. After that I am ready to take a hike that goes for several
kilometers. During my hike, I enjoy the fresh smell of pines and beautiful
landscapes which my region holds. The most important thing about these
hikes is that they remove all the unnecessary thoughts from my head and
help me concentrate on the things which matter.

If you are one of those people that can't find time for nature and you are
loaded with stress, I hope that you found some inspiration in my words and
I heavily encourage you to go out and feel the beautiful and secret sides
of our natural habitat!

Hail Sun! Hail the Gods! Hail our ancestors!
