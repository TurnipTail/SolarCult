Circle dances can be seen in the tradition of dancing round the may pole.

Circle dance, or chain dance, is a style of dance done in a circle or
semicircle to musical accompaniment, such as rhythm instruments and
singing. Circle dancing is probably the oldest known dance formation and
was part of community life from when people first started to dance.

Dancing in a circle is an ancient tradition common to many cultures for
marking special occasions, rituals, strengthening community and encouraging
togetherness. 
The circle dance of Germany was called "Reigen", which dates from the 10th
century. Dancing around the church or a fire was frequently denounced by
church authorities which only underscores how popular it was.

Circle dances were also found in Czech Republic, dating to the 15th
century. Dancing was primarily done around trees on the village green.
a reference comes from Bulgaria, in a manuscript of a 14th-century sermon,
which calls chain dances "devilish and damned."
