I look without, at morrow's Hue
Luminescent Golden Blue
Dawning on those dying leaves
Adieu ye Summer Days and Eves

And now the pluming Fire-Cloud
Burning 'way the twilight shrouds
Announces forth that rising Day
Bidding darkness Heed! Give way!

But gone now is Glee of Summer Months
Now Banshee shrieks and One-Eye Hunts
For Ettin souls at Even's War
Beware hooves' clank in wood and moore
Lest ye be taken to the skies
On Grey-Beard's endless Winter Ride

Keep safe and warm and Keep Alert
In cabin, cottage, hut or yurt
Until that Yule-Day Sun doth rise
And end the Sun-Wheel's long demise
And Halt the frigid Winter-tide
Be Warm, Be Ware, and Watch the Skies!
