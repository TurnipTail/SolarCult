The European Elder Tree (species: Sambucus nigra, from the family
Adoxaceae) holds a prominent place in native folklore.

In pre-Christian times, Indo-European peoples utilised the properties of
the Elder Tree for medicinal and spiritual purposes, and thus they held it
in reverence.

In the British Isles, it was customary to tip one's hat towards the Elder
Tree as a mark of respect, and specifically in England & Scandinavia, those
taking from the tree must ask permission from the Elder Mother (Danish:
Hyldemoer) to use its materials.

"Old girl, give me some of thy wood and I will give thee some of mine when
I grow into a tree" â€” typical recitation in England & Scandinavia.
