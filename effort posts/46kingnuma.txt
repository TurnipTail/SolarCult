The Start of Numa’s Reign as the Second King of Rome after Romulus

Accordingly an augur (who thereafter, as a mark of honour, was made a
priest of the state in permanent charge of that function) conducted him
(Numa Pompilius) to the citadel and caused him to sit down on a stone,
facing the south. The augur seated himself on Numa's left, having his head
covered, and holding his in right hand the crooked staff without a knot
which they call a lituus. Then, looking out over the City and the country
beyond, he prayed to the gods, and marked off the heavens by a line from
east to west, designating as ' right' the regions to the south, as 'left'
those to the north, and fixing in his mind a landmark opposite to him and
as far away as the eye could reach; next shifting the crook to his left
hand and, laying his right hand on Numa's head, he uttered the following
prayer: “Father Jupiter, if it is Heaven's will that this man Numa
Pompilius, whose head I am touching, be king in Rome, do thou exhibit to us
unmistakable signs within those limits which I have set.” He then specified
the auspices which he desired should be sent, and upon their appearance
Numa was declared king, and so descended from the augural station.

- Livy (1.18)


Here we can see Numa, perhaps the most pious king of Rome, used divination
to confirm his right to rule, after he was unanimously voted for by the
senators. This sort of divination should be revitalised in our new growing
communities, especially when it comes to important decisions and confirming
the Gods are on our sides regarding a particular action.
