Medb, Goddess of Mead and Sovereignty 

Medb, queen of Connacht. From the Proto-Celtic *medu-, “mead” or *medua, “intoxicating.” Legendary stand-in for the goddess of mead and sovereignty.

Medb and her cognate, the Indian Madhavi, with derivatives such as madhu, “sweet, honey, mead,” are daughters of the ideal kings Eochaid Feidlech and Yayati, kings who are models of justice, and rulers of a Golden Age.

As Madhavi sacrifices her womb to save her father’s kingdom, in so doing producing four sons who correspond to the three social functions, Medb’s sister Clothru agrees to bear a son by three fathers in order that her family’s line will have heirs, a son who when born is divided into thirds by two red stripes. This son, Lugaid Riab nDerg, then becomes High King of Ireland.

Medb guarantees the permanence or the renewal of the triad of royal virtues defined according to the three functions and provides for the establishment of good kingdoms.
