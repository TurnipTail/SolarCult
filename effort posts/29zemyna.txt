Lithuanian Earth Goddess

In Lithuanian, one of the most important goddesses to the Romuva religion is Žemyna, also sometimes referred to as Žemynela.  

Her name is undoubtedly connected to the Lithuanian word “žeme”, meaning earth, from the Proto-Indo-European word *d?é??om.  Contrast this with the English word “earth”, rooted in the West Germanic *erþu, (perhaps the source of the Germanic Earth Mother “Nerthus”, attested by Tacitus), itself rooted in the the PIE word *h1er.  

In Lithuanian folklore and mythology, Žemyna is the daughter of the the Sun goddess Saule and the moon god Menulis.  Her holiday is known as Žolines, however in modern times this holiday has been absorbed by the Catholic Church as the cult of the Virgin Mary.
