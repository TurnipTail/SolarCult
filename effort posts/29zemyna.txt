Lithuanian Earth Goddess

In Lithuanian, one of the most important goddesses to the Romuva religion
is Žemyna, also sometimes referred to as Žemynela.  

Her name is undoubtedly connected to the Lithuanian word “žeme”, meaning
earth, from the Proto-Indo-European word *d?é??om.  Contrast this with the
English word “earth”, rooted in the West Germanic *erþu, (perhaps the
source of the Germanic Earth Mother “Nerthus”, attested by Tacitus), itself
rooted in the the PIE word *h1er.  

In Lithuanian folklore and mythology, Žemyna is the daughter of the the Sun
goddess Saule and the moon god Menulis.  Her holiday is known as Žolines,
however in modern times this holiday has been absorbed by the Catholic
Church as the cult of the Virgin Mary.
