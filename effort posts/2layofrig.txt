The Lay of Rig (Rígsþula) is an important poem of The Edda. In it, the
tripartite structure of society - as in in the Indo-European tradition - is
presented; Heimdall travels and figuratively fathers all three races that
correspond to the classes of labourer, farmer and noble.

Rígsþula, 13;

Daughters had they, Drumba and Kumba,
Ökkvinkalfa, Arinnefla,
Ysja and Ambott, Eikintjasna,
Totrughypja and Tronubeina;
And thence has risen the race of thralls.

The thralls correspond to peasants, or one of the 'houses' of society.

Similarly, the farmers' race born in the 25th stanza represents the next
house, followed by the nobleman born in the 34th.

The author demonstrates the values of nobility from his description of
their qualities and what he does for them;

36; 'Then out of the thicket came Rig walking,
Rig came walking taught him the #Runes.'

37; '(He) made his horse gallop, wielded his sword;
He awakened a war, began to redden the plain,
Began to fell dead men, he fought to gain lands.'

38; 'Then he alone ruled eighteen settlements;
He started to share his wealth, offered to everyone.'

Finally, the Lay of Rig concludes showing both the benevolent and faustian
aspects of the Noble Caste;

42; 'Those born to Lord grew up there,
Tamed horses, bound rims to shields,
Smoothed arrow-shafts, brandished ash spears.'

43; 'But the young Kin learned Runes to use,
Runes everlasting, the runes of life;
Soon could he well the warrior's shield,
Dull the sword blades and still the seas.'

This poem is significant because it demonstrates Nordic social
stratification along Indo-European lines; tripartite, yet devoid of a
priestly class. Or perhaps this wasn't considered important, or perhaps it
was taken as a given that the nobility performed priestly roles.
