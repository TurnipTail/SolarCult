It goes without saying that Oath-swearing is a critical component of the pre-Christian religions of Europe, and this goes doubly for Sacrifice.  However, nowhere are the concepts better represented than in the story of Tyr and the binding of the Fenris wolf, from Snorri’s younger Edda.

We all know the story, and if you don’t, it’s absolutely worth a read.  It is both tragic and inspirational.  Yet it casts into light a murky grey area of pre-Christian morality. 

In relation to the wolf’s binding, the Aesir swore an oath:
“...if though shalt not be able to burst this band, then thou wilt not be able to frighten the gods; and then we shall unloosen thee.”
As a collateral to this oath, the wolf demanded a God place their hand in its mouth.  The only one with the courage, or perhaps the honor to do so was Tyr.

Clearly Tyr knew the wolf would take his hand, and worse still, Tyr was the only member of the Aesir who cared for the wolf up to this point.  Yet at the same time, he knew what the wolf would bring, the destruction it would wreak.  So the God willfully sacrificed his hand to stave off the destruction of the Aesir, and worse still, sacrificed a potential friendship in the process.

And yet, this God had the honor to hold his end of the bargain.  A sacrifice for a broken oath, to a monster destined to ruin them.  Yet couldn’t he have removed his hand before the wolf realized it was trapped?

Here we get a sense of the power of the oath.  As we can see, broken oaths have consequences.  Remember to speak forthright, and to follow through on your words and promises, with deeds.  

And remember the courage and honor of Tyr.  Remember that we are part of something greater, our kin, our clan, and our race, and you may be called to Sacrifice what you hold as dear to these greater causes.
