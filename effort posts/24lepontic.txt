Lepontic Script

Language and alphabets associated with the Cisalpine (modern day southern
Switzerland/northern Italy) La Tène culture (~500-100 B.C.).  Inscriptions
are found mainly centered around the Swiss city of Lugano.

While there is some debate, it is generally regarded to be a Celtic
language and script.  Only about 140 inscriptions are known at this time,
which limits the ability of researchers to decipher this language.

Of note to researchers is the similarity of many of the Lepontic characters
to the later Germanic Elder Futhark runes.  In addition, Lepontic may be an
adaptation from Rhaetic, a pre-Indo-European lagnguage extending from
western Austria to eastern Switzerland.
