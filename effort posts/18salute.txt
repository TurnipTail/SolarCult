Daily Salute to the Sun 

A simple personal discipline of remembering the Eternal Sun three times daily. The purpose of this prayer is to develop personal spiritual responsibility and to infuse daily life with a remembrance of the Light.

To be said to the Sun in the Morning:
"Hail to thee, the Eternal Spiritual Sun, whose visible Symbol rises now in the Heavens. Hail unto thee from the Abodes of Morning."

To be said to the mid-day Sun:
"Hail to thee, Eternal Spiritual Sun, whose visible Symbol stands at the height of the Heavens. Hail unto thee from the Abodes of Noontime."

To be said to the setting Sun: 
"Hail to thee, Eternal Spiritual Sun, whose visible Symbol sets now in the Heavens. Hail unto thee from the Abodes of Evening."

(This Daily Salute is a modern adaptation from a Western Magical text) 

Sent to me by a friend, interesting to think about at the least. I personally won't adopt something like this however.
