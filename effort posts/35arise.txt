Arise, O Noble Land,
And commit thyself to Holy War!
Take rifle and spear in hand
And honor the oath that you swore!

Where are your saints, o glorious Folk?
Where is Theodoric? Where is Siegfried?
Arise, honored Race, cast off the foreign yoke
And set fire to the corrupted weeds!

Arise, O Noble Land,
And stand loyally and true 
Against the Legions of the Damned
And greet the new-dawn of blue!

Where are your heroes, o honored Aryans?
Where is Hitler? Where is Eggers?
Arise, fearsome fighters, as the sky darkens
And struggle greater than ever

Arise, O Noble Land,
And slaughter the evil foe
And send out the firebrands
And stomp out the last of the shadows

Where are you, great God-Man?
Where are you, Mother of the Race?
Arise, Aryans, and from the world
The demons we shall erase!
