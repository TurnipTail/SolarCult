Principles of Permaculture:

Permaculture: an integrated, evolving system of perennial or self-perpetuating plant and animal species useful to man, - David Holmgren
Permaculture derives from “permanent culture”. In comparison to agriculture, the goal of Permaculture is to create a sustainable permanent system. In Permaculture, you learn how to work with nature rather than against. The goal is to create a system that is sustainable, productive and in symbiosis with nature. It is as much a philosophy as a system. It is about self-reliance, biodiversity, cleaner waters, healthier soil and most important of all - healthier humans. Permaculture offers an intelligent way of designing and planning a garden, whether it is a communal garden or private land. 

A biodiverse flora will encourage a more multifarious fauna. Keeping the natural ecosystem functioning and healthy is of great importance to humanity, as greater species diversity encourages natural sustainability. 

When planning any sort of Permaculture garden/food forest/urban garden etc, the key aspects would be to use an ethical framework. You observe - to understand how nature works. From this, you may decide which approach to take. Mimicking natural patterns and behaviour is key. The plants you grow should nourish and support each other. Permaculture is as much about food as it is about a way of life. 

You might make an argument that Permaculture is a tangible solution to the detrimental consequences of agriculture and modernity. Modern GMOs, pesticides and antibiotics are all concepts that are foreign to a Permaculture lifestyle. Permaculture seeks to change the system, and in many ways is an anti-globalism concept. To live sustainably, it would not be reasonable to rely on import, but rather local resources. By adopting a Permaculture lifestyle, we can transition from being a dependent consumer to becoming a responsible producer. The more you produce, the more you can share with your local community. 

Imagine your garden being filled with nourishing vegetables, nuts, fruits and herbs. Food is the real currency. A garden is a useful legacy to leave behind for your children.

The Australian environmental designer David Holmgren first formed the Permaculture concept with Bill Mollison. In his book:  “Permaculture Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability” you can find the 12 principles of Permaculture:


     •Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
     •Make hay while the sun shines
     •You can’t work on an empty stomach
     •The sins of the fathers are visited by the children unto the seventh generation
     •Let nature take it’s course
     •A stitch in time saves nine
     •Can’t see the wood for the trees
     •Many hands make light work
     •The bigger they are the harder they fall. Slow and steady wins the race.
     •Don’t put all your eggs in one basket
     •Don’t think you are on the right track just because it is a well-beaten path
     •Vision is not seeing things as they are but as they will be
