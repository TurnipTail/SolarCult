Rosa camuna 

A relatively common petroglyph found in the Val Camonica region of northern Italy, often (but not always) found stylized as a Swastika.  

The exact dating of this symbol is difficult to determine, as the region is rich in petroglyphs dating back to the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, however the symbol is often associated with the Iron Age, and thus, the Camunni people.

Although these people are mentioned in the Greek annals, their origin is unknown.  There are some surviving inscriptions but the corpus is insufficient to class these people as Old European or Indo-European speakers.  Nevertheless, the Swastika-like nature of this symbol commonly used by these people tells us much of the very ancient origin of the Swastika and its various permutations, and how this relates to the various tribes of north Eurasia.

The Rosa camuna, while commonly associated with the Val Camunica region, is not limited to there.

1.) The original Swastika Stone of West Yorkshire, UK.  Its exact age is unknown, possibly Neolithic but most likely Iron Age construction
2.) Guifões Stone of Portugal. Some researchers believe this was imported from Val Camunica, although this is based solely on its similarity, and could have been made de novo.
3.) Celtic (Gaulish) coin found in northern France, circa 1st century B.C. 

There is also a number of examples of this swastika found in churches in England, including the so-called Woden’s swastika in the Sutton church in Bedforshire.  In addition, an example of this symbol found among the Bohuslän rock carvings of Sweden, although an original image can not be found at this time.  But this would link this symbol to the Nordic Bronze Age civilization.
