Winter Solstice

"All life is struggle and victory. Victory however brings the duty of a new struggle. Thus the fight is the content and purpose of a glorious life."

This is the heroic confession of the Teutons, our ancestors who fought this eternal struggle against the relentless ice of the North.

In the North, where the sunfire only offered little possibilities to live, our world view was forged: life was the fight with darkness and cold, where there was no other ally but the peoples will to survive and the sun.

Thus the sun became the image of the Teutons inherent strength.

On this shortest day, when there are only a few warming sun rays, we have to remember this enduring fight of our ancestors for survival.

Today we face another darkness, which is more sinister. Remember that our ancestors endured all dangers nature threw at them at least long enough to hand over the light of life to their children. This task must not be forgotten and today it is our turn to preserve our heritage, facing dangers.
