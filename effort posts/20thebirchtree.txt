The birch is an important tree in the folk traditions of several European countries.

It is associated with the Goddesses Freya and Perchta, and symbolizes youth, love, fertility and femininity, but also renewal, protection, and flexibility.

Regionally, the “May Tree” is often a birch, or a softwood tree topped with a birch, and young men will frequently place a decorated young birch tree or branch at their beloved’s house, in front of her window, as a sign of their interest in her.

In the Scandinavian rune poems, it is associated with the rune Berkana.
